# Matterbot
You're going to build a chatbot in C++!

[See my blog post](https://jlospinoso.github.io/c++/web/rest/mattermost/software/developing/2016/06/14/matterbot.html) for how to
get started with the framework.

You can begin with "Building an example bot." We'll use Slack as the service (no need for Mattermost).

Ask me for URLs and Tokens.

Just like in real life, you're going to have to read documentation and figure things out!
